## Assignment 8: Fibonacci numbers
Fibonacci numbers is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The first and second fibonacci numbers are 1 and 2 respectively. The rest of the fibonacci numbers can be represented using the following formula:
<strong>
F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>
</strong>

where F<sub>n</sub> represents the _(n)th_ fibonacci number, and F<sub>n-1</sub> and F<sub>n-2</sub> represent the _(n-1)th_ and _(n-2)th_ fibonacci numbers respectively.

Starter file: [index.js](./index.js)

## Problem 1
Complete the `firstFibonacci(n)` function defined in the above starter file which prints the first **n** fibonacci numbers, each separated by a comma (`,`).

```
firstFibonacci(10)
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

## Problem 2
Complete the `lastFibonacci(num, k)` function defined in the above starter file which prints the last **k** fibonacci numbers which are less than or equal to **num**, each separated by a comma (`,`).

```
lastFibonacci(500, 5)
55, 89, 144, 233, 377

lastFibonacci(377, 3)
144, 233, 377
```

## Problem 3
Complete the `sumFibonacci(num, k)` function defined in the above starter file which returns the sum of the first **k** fibonacci numbers which are strictly greater than **num**.

```
sumFibonacci(100, 3)
> returns 754
// Hint: 144 + 233 + 377 = 754
```
